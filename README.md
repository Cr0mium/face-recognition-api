# 🧠 face-recognition-api

A full-stack, real-time face recognition system for attendance and identity verification. Combines deep learning (FaceNet embeddings with PyTorch) and classical ML (KNN classifier) in a scalable, Docker-first architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Face detection with MTCNN
- 🧠 Face embedding with InceptionResnetV1 (FaceNet)
- 🧪 Classification with scikit-learn’s KNN
- 📷 React frontend with live webcam capture
- 🎨 Custom face-frame overlay for alignment
- 🧾 Registration with multiple image support
- 🔁 Model auto-update on new user addition
- 🗃️ Embeddings & models saved with NumPy + joblib
- 🐳 Docker-ready architecture (multi-service support)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python · FastAPI · PyTorch · scikit-learn · joblib
- **Frontend**: React.js · Vite · Axios · react-webcam
- **Infra**: Docker · Docker Compose · REST API

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-api.git
cd face-recognition-api
```

### 2. Start the services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the frontend
Visit `http://localhost:5173`

---

## 📦 API Endpoints

### `POST /register`
Registers a new person with multiple face images.

- `Form`: name (str)
- `File[]`: images

### `POST /recognise`
Recognizes a face from a single image.

- `File`: face_image (UploadFile)

Returns:
```json
{
  "match": "Angelina_Jolie",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```
